"""Compute prospectivity score from distances using a Gaussian kernel.

This module defines functions to convert distances to a likelihood score
between 0 and 1. The Gaussian fallâ€‘off is controlled by the
`falloff_km` parameter in the configuration. The score for each cell
is based on the nearest distance to either rock type.
